                                    <h4>SWE Leaders & Learners Program</h4>
                                    <p>This mentoring program is open to all students in the School of Engineering and is designed to help incoming freshmen and sophomore students with their first or second year. Each learner is paired with an upperclassman leader who has the opportunity to guide and mentor them. The leader can provide insightful advice, support, tips/tricks, and more to the learner! The leader and learner will have the opportunity to participate in mandatory events, both fun and informative, within and outside of SWE to help build their relationship through the year. </p>

                                    <p>The SWE Rutgers-Section Industry Mentorship Program is a full year program that aims to prepare its participants for the corporate world. The program pairs SWE members with industry professionals based on the future goals, current engineering track and the general interests of the participant. Through the implementation of bi-weekly activities such as resume critique and elevator pitch prep, the program prepares its participants for events such as career fairs, interviews and the professional workplace. Participating companies include Verizon, Accenture, Mondelez International, Northrop Gruman and more.</p>

                                    <p>The Society of Women Engineers at Rutgers University enjoys helping out our community in as many ways possible. Rutgers SWE members actively participate in annual events run by non-profit organizations such as the Scarlet Day of Service and the Rutgers Dance Marathon. Rutgers SWE also wants to prove that engineering is fun for people of all ages! Therefore, we also hold outreach events to introduce engineering to young students in the form of creative, hands-on activities. </p>

                            <p>Involvement in SWE does not end after graduation. We maintain a strong connection with the Rutgers SWE alumni through networking socials and an Alumni Banquet, where job opportunities and friendships with the alumni are made. With a clear sense of SWE's past endeavors and guidance from our alumni network, we can create events geared toward furthering our members in their engineering discipline, and generating interest in STEM for young women.</p>

                                    <p>SWE welcomed their lovely alumni back for a fun, destress event during the spring! Our collegiate members created origami pieces while chatting with our alumni and SWE NJ. This was a great opportunity for underclassmen to learn about the experiences of upperclassmen and professionals while taking a break from the stressful exam season. The advice and insight into life as women in engineering from the alumni will definitely strengthen and inspire SWE's endeavors!</p>

In addition, every year SWE invites all females accepted to the School of Engineering to SWE Night, where they can learn about what SWE has to offer while also meeting their potential classmates.</p>

                                    <p>The Society of Women Engineers at Rutgers University enjoys spreading the word about engineering and its benefits to as many people as possible. We understand committing to a college is a very scary thing to do as a high school senior, especially in the School of Engineering, so we give prospective students a taste of college life as an engineer through SWE Night! Prospective female engineering students join us in a night of fun with activities and presentations on what to expect in the fall. Then the girls get paired off with a member in SWE and sleep over their on-campus dorm or apartment. If you're on the fence about committing to Rutgers, this is a good night to find out if our school is right for you!</p>
